        <p>
            Coral reefs are diverse underwater ecosystems held together by calcium carbonate structures secreted by corals. These ecosystems are home to a vast array of marine life, including fish, mollusks, crustaceans, and many other species. Coral reefs are often referred to as the "rainforests of the sea" due to their incredible biodiversity.

                    Coral reefs provide numerous benefits. They support approximately 25% of all marine species, making them one of the most diverse ecosystems on the planet. Additionally, reefs act as natural barriers, protecting coastlines from erosion, storm surges, and tsunamis by reducing wave energy. Economically, coral reefs contribute to local economies through tourism, fishing, and recreation, providing millions of jobs and significant revenue. Furthermore, coral reefs are a source of new medicines, including treatments for cancer, HIV, and other diseases. Many marine organisms found in reefs produce compounds with potential therapeutic uses.
